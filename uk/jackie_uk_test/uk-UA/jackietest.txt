Here's an interesting unpopular fact about Jackie Chan: He's not only an actor, but also an outstanding stuntman. In 1998, he created his own production unit to have more creativity and control over his films. This division is called Jackie Chan Films and is responsible for many of his projects, where he himself participated not only as an actor, but also as a director, producer and screenwriter.

In addition, Jackie Chan has his own style of martial arts called Jackie Chan Style, which combines elements of kung fu with acrobatics and comedy. His films often include unique stunts that he performs himself, which makes his creativity even more impressive!
